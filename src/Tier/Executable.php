 * Class Executable

 *
 * i) The injection params are added to the injector
 * ii) The setup callable is called.
 * iii) The tier callable is called.
 *
 * For all of the parameters that are 'callable' they cannot be typed hinted as
 * callable, as Tier also supports instance methods (e.g. ['foo', 'bar'] ) which
 * does not pass the callable test.
