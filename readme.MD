# How to run

I'm working on the docs right now....

The real name for the "pattern" is breaking the execution of a program up into individual blocks. Each of those blocks can have their own set of dependencies.

This is why the 'framework' is called Tier, as it allows you to "arrange in layers" . Each block of execution builds up information to be used by subsequent execution blocks.
